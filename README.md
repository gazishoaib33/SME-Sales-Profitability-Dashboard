# 📊 SME Sales Data Analysis Project 

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis workflow using a simulated retail sales dataset. It demonstrates data cleaning, feature engineering, and financial performance analysis using transactional sales data.

The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze product-level performance
- Evaluate regional sales trends
- Calculate revenue, cost, and profit metrics
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Prepare structured datasets for visualization and business insights

The repository includes both the raw dataset and a cleaned version with engineered financial features (Revenue, Cost, Profit), making it suitable for analytical modeling, dashboard creation, and reporting.

This project is designed to showcase practical data analysis skills, structured project organization, and clean dataset preparation for real-world business scenarios.

## 🎯 Business Recommendations

Based on the data analysis:

1. 📌 **Focus on High-Margin Products**
   - Identify products generating strong profit margins and prioritize marketing efforts for these items.

2. 📌 **Optimize Regional Strategy**
   - Regions with lower profitability may require pricing adjustments, promotional campaigns, or cost optimization strategies.

3. 📌 **Leverage Peak Sales Periods**
   - Increase inventory and marketing investment during high-revenue months to maximize seasonal gains.

4. 📌 **Improve Margin Monitoring**
   - High revenue does not always equal high profit. Regular margin analysis should guide pricing and discount decisions.

5. 📌 **Data-Driven Decision Making**
   - Implement dashboards and automated KPI tracking to continuously monitor business performance.
